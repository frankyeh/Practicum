- Participating Labs/Departments: 

  - [Fiber Tractography Laboratory](https://hdft.labsolver.org/)
  - Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

- Zoom meeting
- Project Instructors:

  - Fang-Cheng (Frank) Yeh, M.D. Ph.D.
  - Linggang Luo

- Prerequisites:

  - Prior training in general neural science (e.g. psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging…etc.)

- Requirement:

  Join a weekly practicum meeting in the Friday morning or afternoon with the course advisors.

- Research Description:

Diffusion MRI has arisen as the only non-invasive way to map fiber bundles and assess their structural integrity in the human brain. Mapping fiber bundles of the human brain and understanding their architecture is one of the largest research efforts in modern neuroscience. The fiber trajectories in the human brain define the essential wiring diagram of all brain connections and inform the basis of all brain function and etiology of many dysfunctions.

In this practicum course, students will 
  1. learn a tractography software tool called [DSI Studio](http://dsi-studio.labsolver) for mapping brain connection trajectories
  2. conduct a short study and write a final report.

- Laboratory Exposure

Participants will learn the neuroanatomy of the target fiber bundle and use “DSI Studio” to map its connection trajectories on a population averaged template. In 2021, there are [250 journal publications using DSI Studio](http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/citation.html) to carry out their studies. The learned skills in thie course can be applied to any brain studies that investigate the structural trajectories of fiber connections.
