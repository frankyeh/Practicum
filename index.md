- Project Title: Mapping Human Brain Connections using Diffusion MRI Fiber Tracking
- Participating Labs/Departments: 

  - [High Definition Fiber Tracking Laboratory](https://hdft.labsolver.org/)
  - Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

- Location: 9F Scaife Hall, University of Pittsburgh Medical School
- Project Instructors:

  - Fang-Cheng (Frank) Yeh, M.D. Ph.D.
  - Linggang Luo

- Prerequisites:

  - Prior training in general neural science (e.g. psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging…etc.)
  - Basic knowledge about brain structures and functions

- Requirement:

  Join a weekly progress meeting in the Friday afternoon with the course advisors.

- Research Description:

Diffusion MRI has arisen as the only non-invasive way to map fiber bundles and assess their structural integrity in the human brain. Mapping fiber bundles of the human brain and understanding their architecture is one of the largest research efforts in modern neuroscience. The fiber trajectories in the human brain define the essential wiring diagram of all brain connections and inform the basis of all brain function and etiology of many dysfunctions.

In this practicum course, students will 
  1. learn a tractography software tool called [DSI Studio](http://dsi-studio.labsolver) for mapping brain connection trajectories
  2. develop his/her own project in mapping one fiber pathway
  3. write a manuscript as the final report.

- Laboratory Exposure

Students will learn the neuroanatomy of the target fiber bundle and use “DSI Studio” to map its connection
trajectories on a population averaged template. In 2018, there are 110 journal publications using DSI Studio to
carry out their studies (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/publications). The learned skills in thie course can be
applied to any brain studies that investigate the structural trajectories of fiber connections.

- Opportunities

1. The project can be extended into a publication (see publication below), with the student listed as the first author of the publication.
2. With the permission of the student’s advisor, the publication could be used as his/her master thesis.
3. Possibility to receive party-time RA support if the project is selected to be continued after the Practicum.
