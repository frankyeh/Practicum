# Fiber Tractography Lab Practicum


- Project Title: Mapping Human Brain Connections using Diffusion MRI Fiber Tracking
- Participating Labs/Departments: 

  - High Definition Fiber Tracking Laboratory (https://hdft.labsolver.org/)
  - Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

- Location: 9F Scaife Hall, University of Pittsburgh Medical School
- Project Instructors:

  - Fang-Cheng (Frank) Yeh, M.D. Ph.D.
  - Linggang Luo

- Prerequisites:

  - Prior training in general neural science (e.g. psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging…etc.)
  - Basic knowledge about brain structures and functions

- Requirement:

  Join a weekly progress meeting in the Friday afternoon with the course advisors.

- Research Description:

Diffusion MRI has arisen as the only non-invasive way to map fiber bundles and assess their structural integrity
in the human brain. Mapping fiber bundles of the human brain and understanding their architecture is one of
the largest research efforts in modern neuroscience. The fiber trajectories in the human brain define the
essential wiring diagram of all brain connections and inform the basis of all brain function and etiology of many
dysfunctions.

In this practicum course, students will (1) learn a tractography software tool called DSI Studio (http://dsi-
studio.labsolver) for mapping brain connection trajectories, (2) develop his/her own project under the guidance
of Dr. Yeh in mapping one fiber pathway, (3) write a manuscript as the final report.

- Laboratory Exposure

Students will learn the neuroanatomy of the target fiber bundle and use “DSI Studio” to map its connection
trajectories on a population averaged template. In 2018, there are 110 journal publications using DSI Studio to
carry out their studies (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/publications). The learned skills in thie course can be
applied to any brain studies that investigate the structural trajectories of fiber connections.
