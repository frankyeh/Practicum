### Practicum task 1: Differential tractography comparing subject data to a template: 

1. Download als05.gqi.1.25.fib.gz, template_nqa.nii.gz, and template_dti_fa.nii.gz from [ALS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q7YdmjaR-8w-pBUYe0nENnm3fiGnP1Md?usp=sharing).

2. Follow the instruction video to get differential tractography. 

3. Adjust minimum length and differential tracking threshold to observe how they change the results.

### Practicum task 2: Differential tractography on longitudinal data: 

1. Download subject files at [TBI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dj59qTblO96Q2xDKaEjtsghMuT8FYE54).

2. Convert and reconstruct base.nii.gz and follow.nii.gz to fib files (using QSDR to register baseline and follow-up scan in the same MNI space).

3. Follow the instruction video to get differential tractography. 

4. Adjust minimum length and differential tracking threshold to observe how they change the results.
