## During practicum on Friday:


#### Differential tractography demonstration


---

### Practicum task 1: Differential tractography comparing subject data to a template: 

1. Download als05.gqi.1.25.fib.gz, from [ALS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q7YdmjaR-8w-pBUYe0nENnm3fiGnP1Md?usp=sharing).

2. Healthy subjects averaged [NQA map](https://zenodo.org/record/6324701/files/Grid258_nqa.nii.gz?download=1) and [FA map](https://zenodo.org/record/6324701/files/Grid258_dti_fa.nii.gz?download=1)

3. Follow the instruction video to get differential tractography. 

4. Adjust minimum length and differential tracking threshold to observe how they change the results.

### Practicum task 2: Differential tractography on longitudinal data: 

1. Download subject files at [TBI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dj59qTblO96Q2xDKaEjtsghMuT8FYE54).

2. Convert and reconstruct base.nii.gz and follow.nii.gz to fib files (using QSDR to register baseline and follow-up scan in the same MNI space).

3. Follow the instruction video to get differential tractography. 

4. Adjust minimum length and differential tracking threshold to observe how they change the results.
